## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

The `&` parent selector was very handy to set custom border colors for each card on this project. I was able to group them all under one selector, then add on to it with a color class.

### Continued development

I look forward to writing with Sass in my future projects.
